       "The provided code defines a Python function named `submit` that is used to submit assignments. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The function takes four parameters:\n",
       "   - `data`: A list of pandas dataframes or images.\n",
       "   - `key`: Your student key that was emailed to you.\n",
       "   - `no`: The assignment class number, should be an integer from 1 to 1.\n",
       "   - `source_file` (optional): The full path to your Python or Jupyter Notebook file. The filename must contain \"_class1\" as part of its name, where the number matches the assignment number.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The function checks if the `source_file` is provided. If not, it tries to get the filename from the `__file__` global variable. If neither is available, it raises an exception.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. It checks if the filename contains the required suffix (`_class{no}`). If not, it raises an exception.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The function reads the contents of the `source_file` and encodes it using Base64 encoding.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. It determines the file extension (`.py` or `.ipynb`) and raises an exception if it's not one of these.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. The function iterates over the `data` list and encodes each item based on its type:\n",
       "   - If the item is a `PIL.Image.Image` object, it saves the image as a PNG format and encodes it using Base64.\n",
       "   - If the item is a `pandas.DataFrame` object, it converts the DataFrame to a CSV string and encodes it using Base64.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. The encoded data, along with the assignment number, file extension, and encoded Python file, are sent as a POST request to the `https://api.heatonresearch.com/assignment-submit` endpoint using the provided `key` as an API key.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. If the request is successful (status code 200), it prints the response text with the \"Success\" message. Otherwise, it prints the response text with the \"Failure\" message.\n",
