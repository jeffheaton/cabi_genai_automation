    "In this section, we delve into the creation of an innovative utility class designed for managing chat interactionsâ€”aptly named ChatBot. This class stands as a cornerstone for applications that require robust handling of chat history, including features to load and save these interactions, as well as capabilities to undo or regenerate outputs. The architecture of ChatBot integrates advanced language models with structured templates to facilitate interactive conversations, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of ChatBot revolves around its sophisticated integration of components from the langchain ecosystem. It utilizes a large language model for generating chat responses and another for summarizing conversations, complemented by a template that structures each interaction. Key features include maintaining an editable conversation history, implementing undo and regenerate operations for greater control over chat flows, and mechanisms to persist conversation states, enhancing the utility and flexibility of the chat interface. As we explore ChatBot, we will uncover how each component contributes to its overall capability to manage complex conversational contexts effectively.\n",

    "## Implementing the Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we delve into the architecture of a sophisticated chatbot built using the LangChain and Bedrock libraries, encapsulated within the ChatBot class. The ChatBot class leverages two language models and a structured conversation template to engage users in a dynamic conversational flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class initiates by defining its basic components: llm_chat and llm_summary are large language models used for chat responses and conversation summarization, respectively. The template parameter defines the conversation's structure, guiding how interactions are formatted and presented. This template incorporates markdown formatting and placeholders for the conversation history and the latest user input, facilitating a clear and structured dialogue presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon instantiation, the ChatBot initializes various components. It constructs a PromptTemplate, which prepares the structure for input variables and the conversation template. The ConversationSummaryMemory, initialized with the llm_summary, acts as a dynamic storage for conversation excerpts, aiding in recalling context or summarizing past dialogues. This memory component is crucial for maintaining conversation continuity, especially in sessions that might span multiple interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ConversationChain is another pivotal element, combining the prompt template with the llm_chat model to process and respond to user inputs. The chain's verbose mode is set to False to streamline output without extraneous system messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction with the ChatBot is primarily through the chat method, where users provide a prompt, and the bot displays the response after processing. Internally, the converse method updates the conversation history and uses the conversation chain to generate a response. This method's utility lies in its ability to append each interaction to the history log, ensuring all discourse components are retained for future reference or undo actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management functions like print_memory, clear_memory, and undo provide users and developers with tools to view, reset, or revert the conversation state, thus offering flexibility in managing the dialogue flow and content. Additional functionalities to save and load conversation history are provided through save_history and load_history, utilizing Pythonâ€™s pickle module for object serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class structure not only facilitates robust conversation handling and memory management but also showcases the integration of advanced language models in practical applications, demonstrating the potential of AI in enhancing interactive software solutions. Through such a detailed setup, ChatBot serves as a comprehensive framework for building interactive, memory-aware chatbot systems."
