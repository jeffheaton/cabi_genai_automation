    "Spell checkers can be tricky to code. With the large diversity of names around the world, sometimes people's names are flagged as typos. There is a campaign named [#iamnotatypo](https://www.iamnotatypo.org/) that attempts to build a list of people's names; however, maybe AI can help. As a human, usually I can determine if words are a name just from context. Consider the following paragraph where many of the names would be flagged by MS-Word as typos. Can GenAI find all the names in this paragraph? Just to make it more like text a human would generate, I \"forgot\" to capitalize a few of the names.\n",
